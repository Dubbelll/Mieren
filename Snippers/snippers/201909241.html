				<p>
					I often think about the idea that there is only so much you can care about. Some
					people describe this as the amount of fucks they have to give, which is usually
					a finite amount. As the years in my (short) career go on, I've increasingly felt
					the relevance of this concept in software development.
				</p>
				<p>
					While they are only part of the puzzle, I believe that compilers and type
					systems can offload a significant amount of concerns that take up valuable time
					and energy. Instead of having to think about everything that can go wrong, they
					let you focus on building features and adding value to the product.
				</p>
				<p>
					To make this theory more concrete, I'll be talking about my favourite
					programming language: Elm. It is by no means the only language that can
					illustrate my point, but I am comfortable with it and believe that it will aptly
					show what can be gained.
				</p>
				<h2>Building blocks</h2>
				<p>
					Somewhat surprisingly, the possible reduction in mental strain can already be
					seen in Elm's most basic building blocks. The first thing you have to do when
					writing a new function, is coming up with its type signature.
				</p>
				<code>
					multiply : Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int
					<br />
					multiply a b = a * b
				</code>
				<p>
					This type signature says that multiply takes two integers and returns an
					integer. Thanks to the compiler, you can be completely sure that when this
					function is called, that's exactly what will happen. If anyone tries to misuse
					it, like giving it a float instead of an integer, it will be caught at compile
					time.
				</p>
				<code>
					— TYPE MISMATCH —
					<br />
					The 1st argument to `multiply` is not what I expect:
					<br />
					<br />
					7 | multiply 2.5 2
					<br />
					<br />
					This argument is a float of type:
					<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Float
					<br />
					But `multiply` needs the 1st argument to be:
					<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Int
					<br />
					<br />
					Note: Read &lt;https://elm-lang.org/0.19.1/implicit-casts&gt; to learn why Elm
					does not implicitly convert Ints to Floats.
					<br />
					Use toFloat and round to do explicit conversions.
				</code>
				<p>
					Not only will it be caught, the compiler will tell us what is wrong, what we can
					do to fix it and (sometimes) even why it behaves that way, all in a friendly and
					clear message.
				</p>
				<p>
					By front loading important questions and having the type system and compiler to
					back up your decisions, you don't have to think about a whole category of
					possible problems afterwards. No more “What if one of the arguments is null?”,
					“What happens when George accidentally sends it an array?”, “What is the type of
					the output”?, not even the whimsical “Will it always have the same type of
					output?”.
				</p>
				<h2>A case for iteration</h2>
				<p>
					One part of software development where compilers and type systems can really
					shine is during refactoring. I think most people would agree that being able to
					iterate often and without fear can play a big part in successful development
					cycles.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let's say that we have a simple custom type called Vegetable that can be either
					a Carrot or a Cucumber and a transformer function that uses a case statement to
					turn a Vegetable into a String.
				</p>
				<code>
					type Vegetable
					<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= Carrot
					<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Cucumber
					<br />
					<br />
					vegetableToString : Vegetable -&gt; String
					<br />
					vegetableToString vegetable =
					<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case vegetable of
					<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carrot -&gt; "Carrot"
					<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cucumber -&gt; "Cucumber"
				</code>
				<p>
					We notice, however, that our Vegetable type is quite limited, so we quickly add
					another one to it.
				</p>
				<code>
					type Vegetable
					<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= Carrot
					<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Cucumber
					<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Cabbage
				</code>
				<p>
					When we try to compile our code, the compiler will not be happy because we
					haven't added a branch for Cabbage to our vegetableToString function.
					Thankfully, it'll guide us towards fool proofing our program once again.
				</p>
				<code>
					— MISSING PATTERNS —
					<br />
					This `case` does not have branches for all possibilities:
					<br />
					<br />
					13| case vegetable of
					<br />
					14| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carrot -&gt; "Carrot"
					<br />
					15| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cucumber -&gt; "Cucumber"
					<br />
					<br />
					Missing possibilities include:
					<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cabbage
					<br />
					<br />
					I would have to crash if I saw one of those. Add branches for them!
					<br />
					<br />
					Hint: If you want to write the code for each branch later, use `Debug.todo` as a
					placeholder.
					<br />
					Read &lt;https://elm-lang.org/0.19.1/missing-patterns&gt; for more guidance on
					this workflow.
				</code>
				<p>
					Safeguards like these can take away a lot of uncertainties that come with
					refactoring and allow you to make sweeping changes without batting an eye.
					Sometimes it may feel like you are fighting the compiler, but if you look at it
					from a different perspective it's more akin to a designated driver: a shining
					force of reason guiding you through the chaos.
				</p>
				<h2>Opening the door to strangers</h2>
				<p>
					Taking it one step further, let's imagine that our vegetable comes as the result
					of an HTTP call to a server. We know what the response should look like, but
					since we don't know when that might change and keeping in mind that our request
					can always fail, we're not guaranteed to get what we asked for.
				</p>
				<p>
					In a lot of languages this is handled by the null concept, which thankfully does
					not exist in Elm. Instead, it has the Maybe type (a.k.a Option(al)), which
					forces you to always consider that there might be nothing to work with.
				</p>
				<code>
					vegetableToString : Maybe Vegetable -&gt; String
					<br />
					vegetableToString vegetable =
					<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case vegetable of
					<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just v -&gt;
					<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case v
					of
					<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carrot
					-&gt; "Carrot"
					<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cucumber
					-&gt; "Cucumber"
					<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cabbage
					-&gt; "Cabbage"
					<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing -&gt;
					<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unknown"
				</code>
				<p>
					By changing our vegetable's type to Maybe Vegetable, we must deal with the fact
					that it might not be there. Once we do, it's business as usual. Of course it's
					not advisable to use Maybe all over the place, but when it's necessary it can be
					a powerful ally.
				</p>
				<p>
					You'll probably run into Maybe quite early in your Elm experience, as it is used
					to solve problems such as using an index to retrieve an item from an array that
					may or may not exist. It may frustrate you, it adds boilerplate and it feels
					weird at first, but it frees your mind of an enormous burden. Let's appreciate
					that for a moment: a world without null and undefined!
				</p>
				<h2>Nobody cares</h2>
				<p>
					Of course not everyone will care. In fact, looking at what's currently popular
					and what I've personally experienced, most people don't. Some simply don't think
					about software development that way. They never experience all the uncertainty,
					unknowns and what-ifs eating away their productive thoughts. It's as if someone
					in a meeting room shouts “Isn't that noise driving you crazy?!” and they respond
					with “What noise?”. Others might argue that the problems and concerns eliminated
					by type systems and compilers are not significant and that they could either
					just fix those problems when they occur, or proactively defend against them.
				</p>
				<p>
					However envious I may sometimes feel of these types of people, this post is
					obviously not for them. If you're anything like me, you do often experience
					those worries and fret about everything that could go wrong. Whatever the case
					may be, I sincerely hope more people will start seeing the value of clear and
					friendly error messages, great type systems and fantastic compilers. I truly
					believe we could be building better software and having less frustrating
					experiences as developers, even though there is currently little financial
					incentive to do so.
				</p>
				<p>
					So, should you ever feel like you're running out of fucks, just know that there
					are tools out there to help you recover some. Even if you don't, you might be
					surprised by the different perspective they can offer and the shift in focus
					they might provide. While most people don't care, it can still be worthwhile to
					explore what's out there. Be warned though, it may be hard to go back.
